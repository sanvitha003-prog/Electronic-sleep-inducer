Sleep Inducer - Simple Netlist (human-readable)

Components:
U1  FPGA_DEV_BOARD   - I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL, PWM_OUT, BUTTON_IN, I2S_SD, 3V3, GND
U2  MAX30102         - VCC(3.3V), GND, SDA, SCL, INT (optional)
Q1  MOSFET_N         - G (PWM_OUT via 100R), D (LED Cathode), S (GND)
LED1 LED             - Anode (to 3.3V/5V via current limit), Cathode (to MOSFET D)
SW1 Button           - One side to 3.3V, other to BUTTON_IN (10k pulldown to GND)
R1  100R             - PWM to MOSFET gate series resistor
R2  100k             - MOSFET gate pulldown
R3  220R             - LED current limit (if driven from GPIO low-power)
R4,R5 4.7k           - I2C pull-ups to 3.3V (if needed)
C1  0.1uF            - Decoupling at MAX30102 VCC
C2  10uF             - Bulk cap near regulator

Nets:
3V3 -> U1.3V3, U2.VCC, LED1.Anode (via limit), etc.
GND -> U1.GND, U2.GND, Q1.S, C1-, C2-
SDA -> U1.I2C_SDA, U2.SDA, R4 to 3V3
SCL -> U1.I2C_SCL, U2.SCL, R5 to 3V3
PWM -> U1.PWM_OUT, R1, Q1.G
LED_CATH -> Q1.D, LED1.Cathode
BUTTON -> U1.BUTTON_IN, SW1, Rpull (10k to GND)

Notes:
- Use LVCMOS33 IO standard for FPGA pins.
- For high-power LEDs use a proper constant-current driver and heatsink.
- This netlist is for guidance; import into KiCad and create symbols/footprints accordingly.
